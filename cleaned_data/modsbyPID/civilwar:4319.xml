      <title>Letter, Henry B. Wetzell in Easton, Pa., to his father, 1866 Sept. 25</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Henry B. Wetzell wrote to his father, Aaron Wetzell, on September 25, 1866. He mentioned two fairs. He mentioned how he was getting his "specimens and circulars ready". He had some fine specimens and was going to distribute 10,000 circulars. He had asked for "newboys" and they had arrived. He was ready to commence the next day. He felt proud of what he had to present at the fair. He felt other people dropped out of competition due to him being there. He mentioned a Democratic meeting being held in Easton that night.</abstract>
