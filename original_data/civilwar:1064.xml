      <title>Letter, Southgate Cregmile in Camp Chase, Ohio to Crittenden Cregmile , 1862, March 19</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>19 March 1862 Southgate Cregmile in Camp Chase, Ohio, to his brother Crittenden Cregmile. Acknowledges receipt of his letter and expresses pleasure at hearing from home. Updates him on the health status of his unit and mentions that at least two or three in the camp, as a whole, have died per day since he&apos;s been there. The weather determines how often they are able to drill. Because guarding the prisoners of war is the highest priority, Infantry Colonel Moody has ordered a continuous brigade guard surrounding the camp, with guns drawn, resulting in each guard rotating in every three to four days. With little to look forward to, it seems that ever since Christmas those on guard have been told that next week is payday.</abstract>
