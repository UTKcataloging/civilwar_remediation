      <title>Letter, David L. Jones in Nashville, Tenn. to Anna Jones in Allegheny City, Pa, 1865 July 31</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>31 July 1865 David L. Jones in Nashville, Tenn. to his wife, Anna Jones in Allegheny City, Pa. Grateful that both he and his entire family are well. Has spent most of his day cleaning up for a Regimental inspection. Since his unit is not under the Laws of the Regular army, his days are filled with drill, as well as duty, while being expected to remain pristine in appearance. Because his commanding officers can&apos;t even be trusted with the unit&apos;s rations, he refuses to believe anyone or anything they say. Since being away from home, his friends and family seem to be taking advantage of him also. Looking forward to better times, he would rather be on duty anywhere but in the barracks.</abstract>
