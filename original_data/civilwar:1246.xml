      <title>Letter, from Joseph Linn King in Knoxville, Tenn. to John Bracklesby in Hartford, Conn., 1865 September 30</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>In this letter, dated September 30, 1865, from Joseph Linn King in Knoxville, Tenn. to John Bracklesby in Hartford, CT, King discusses politics and legal cases in post-Civil War Knoxville. King describes Knoxville as &quot;improved materially recently and I observe a more moderate tone in the late 2 mos. of the Knoxville Whig also.&quot; He also talks about a case in which the judge sentenced a man to six years in prison for &quot;intimidating and takeing [sic] from one of his neighbours 2 sides of Bacon.&quot; The judge &quot;in his charge stated to the jury that a rebel stood before the law the same as a Union man, and that there was no law that allowed one citizen to rob another because of his political opinions.&quot; King also mentions that he has made arrangements to move his family and business to Atlanta by November 1.</abstract>
