      <title>Letter, David L. Jones in Nashville, Tenn. to Anna Jones in Allegheny City, Pa., 1865 May 25</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>25 May 1865 David L. Jones in Nashville, Tenn. to his wife, Anna Jones in Allegheny, Pa. Writes that she may receive a flood of unsent letters soon; now that the river bridge from Nashville has been repaired. Continues by telling her that he prefers to leave the barracks and his regular routine, when writing to her. His reading of both Old and New Testaments is well underway. Discounts something she may have read in the Pittsburgh paper to be untrue. Namely, the majority of the Southern Army are &quot;boys.&quot; Sustained by faith and sending his love to her and kisses to their children, he so looks forward to leaving there; but allows that if he lives, he will surely have the opportunity to write another letter tomorrow.</abstract>
