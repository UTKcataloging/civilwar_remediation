Presley of the 1st Alabama Cavalry, Company A wrote to his wife in Prattville, Alabama on September 20, 1862 from &quot;camp direction Chattanooga.&quot; He mentioned a minor health problem and that he had orders to leave soon for Knoxville. He mentioned 2 men who were with him that were sick. Presley mentioned his need for a horse. He said the ones in the cavalry weren&apos;t very good.
