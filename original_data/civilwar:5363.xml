      <title>Letter, Captain Albert Woodcock in Franklin, Tenn. to Leute in Place Unknown, 1863, May 6</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>Capt. Albert Woodcock of the 92nd Illinois who was stationed in Franklin, Tenn. wrote to his wife, Lucy (Lute), on May 6, 1863. He spoke about fatigue and the miserably cold weather. One division had moved out to attack the enemy at Spring Hill. He figured his unit would be sent out before night as a reinforcement. He reminded her to send the Capt. some articles. He hadn&apos;t received letters from her everyday so wondered if she was writing daily. He figured everybody at home was busy. He asked about the family. He felt bad that she was alone rearing the children, but told her he knew she could do it well. He told her his company was healthy and working hard and about the daily happenings at camp. He drew a small diagram of his position.</abstract>
