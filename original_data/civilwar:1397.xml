      <title>Letter, Henry Cherry in Knoxville, Tenn. to Amos Gould in Owosso, Mich., 1865 May 2</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>In this letter, dated May 2, 1865, from Henry Cherry in Knoxville, Tenn. to Amos Gould, Cherry talks of Maryville College and Professor Lamar during the war years, saying &quot;the College was broken up, but he remained.&quot; Speaks of a friendship with an unnamed &quot;wealthy planter&quot; who is an elder in a local Presbyterian Church and friends with the Speaker of the House and Governor Brownlow. Asks again for a letter of recommendation, saying &quot;the Universities, Colleges &amp; Academies, &amp; schools have all collapsed, &amp; will have to be reorganized, &amp; I want to assist in doing it.&quot; Also discusses his views of Reconstruction, arguing &quot;the matter of &apos;Reconstruction&apos; will involve a great many very nice points in law &amp; in morals and in practicability also for what will work pretty well in one neighborhood will not reach the peculiarities of another.&quot;</abstract>
